âœ… Knowledge Check: Why is Pandas a versatile tool for data import in Python?
Pandas is a versatile tool for data import in Python due to its powerful data structures like DataFrames and Series, which simplify data manipulation. 
It supports a wide range of file formats (CSV, Excel, JSON, SQL, etc.), allowing for easy data import and export. 
Its efficient handling of large datasets and ability to perform complex data transformations and analysis make it an indispensable tool for data processing.

ðŸš€ Challenge: Find a version of the Iris dataset that includes column names in the CSV file. Import this dataset and show the initial few rows.
import pandas as pd
# Importing the Iris dataset without column names
iris_data = pd.read_csv('iris.data', header=None)
print(iris_data.head())
# Importing the Iris dataset with column names
iris_data = pd.read_csv('iris.data', names=['sepal_length', 'sepal_width', 'petal_length', 'petal_width', 'species'])
print(iris_data.head())

âœ… Knowledge Check: Why would you want to import data from Google Drive in Colab instead of putting it in the local environment?
The short answer to why you would want to import data from Google Drive in Colab instead of putting it in the local environment is:
1. **Storage Capacity**: Google Drive typically offers more storage space compared to the limited local environment of Colab.
2. **Data Persistence**: Data stored on Google Drive persists across different Colab sessions, unlike the ephemeral local environment that resets after the session ends.
3. **Accessibility**: Data on Google Drive can be accessed from anywhere and shared easily, making collaboration more convenient.
4. **Efficiency**: It's often faster to load data directly from Google Drive into Colab, especially for large datasets, as opposed to uploading it from a local machine each time.

ðŸš€ Challenge: Using the previously found Iris dataset with column names, upload it to your google Google Drive and then import it from a Colab notebook. To confirm that the data was imported correctly, display the first few rows.
Upload the Iris dataset to Google Drive: First, you need to have the Iris dataset file (commonly named iris.data) and upload it to a folder in your Google Drive.
from google.colab import drive
drive.mount('/content/drive')
import pandas as pd
iris_data = pd.read_csv('/content/drive/My Drive/iris.data')
print(iris_data.head())
