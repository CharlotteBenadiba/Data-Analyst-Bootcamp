# Exercises

## Exercise 1: Gathering and Exploring the Iris Dataset

1. Download the Iris dataset from Kaggle.
2. Load the dataset into a Python environment using Pandas.
3. Perform basic exploration:
  - Display the first few rows.
  - Print summary statistics.
  - Identify missing values in each column.

## Exercise 2: Data Integration and Cleaning on the Titanic Dataset 

- Use the titanic dataset.
- Load the dataset into Python using Pandas.
- Visualize the data distribution for the age column using a box plot.
- Identify outliers using statistical methods (e.g., Z-score, IQR).
- Apply a method to handle outliers - this could be removing, adjusting, or replacing these values.
- Re-visualize the column to show the effect of handling the outliers.

## Exercise 3: Data Normalization on the Titanic Dataset (medium)

- Import the titanic dataset using Pandas in Python.
- Apply Min-Max normalization and Z-score normalization to these columns : Age and Fare
- Compare the distributions before and after normalization using histograms.

## Exercise 4 : Data Reduction and Aggregation (medium)

- Perform data reduction on the titanic dataset by implementing dimensionality reduction techniques like Principal Component Analysis (PCA).
- Aggregate the data by a categorical column (like date or region) and calculate summary statistics (mean, sum, etc.).
- Visualize the aggregated data using appropriate plots.

## Exercise 5 : Exploring Dimensionality Reduction Techniques (Hard)

- Read this article : [A Complete Guide On Dimensionality Reduction](https://medium.com/analytics-vidhya/a-complete-guide-on-dimensionality-reduction-62d9698013d
- Import this [dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/datascientistanna/customers-dataset)
- Implement Principal Component Analysis (PCA) and observe how much variance is retained with different numbers of components.
- Apply at least one more dimensionality reduction technique (like t-SNE or LDA) and compare its results with PCA.
- Visualize the results of these techniques using plots.
- Write a brief analysis of how dimensionality reduction impacted the dataset and the insights you gained from the visualizations.
