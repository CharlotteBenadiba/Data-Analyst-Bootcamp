    * Answer: D. 'PassengerId'
âœ… Knowledge Check : What is the purpose of Min-Max normalization?
The purpose of Min-Max normalization is to rescale data to have values between 0 and 1. This normalization technique is used to bring data on different scales to a standard scale, making it easier to compare and analyze. It ensures that all data values are proportionally adjusted to fit within the specified range, where the minimum value in the original data is mapped to 0, and the maximum value is mapped to 1. Min-Max normalization does not change the relative relationships between data points but ensures that they fall within a common scale, which is particularly important when dealing with machine learning algorithms that are sensitive to the scale of input features.

âœ… Knowledge Check : In the provided code, what does the 'reduced_data' variable represent after applying PCA with two components?
After applying PCA with two components, the 'reduced_data' variable represents the original data 'original_data' transformed into a lower-dimensional space with only two principal components. Each row in 'reduced_data' corresponds to a data point in the reduced 2D space, where the original features have been projected and represented in a way that retains the most important information.
âœ… Knowledge Check : When might data aggregation be useful in data analysis?
Data aggregation can be useful in data analysis in the following scenarios:
* When you have a large amount of detailed data, and you want to summarize it for higher-level insights.
* When you need to simplify complex data to make it more manageable and understandable.
* When you want to create summary statistics or reports for decision-making.
* When you are dealing with time series data and want to convert it into larger time intervals (e.g., aggregating daily data into monthly data).
* When you want to reduce the dimensionality of a dataset while preserving key information.
* When you want to group data by specific attributes to analyze patterns or trends within those groups.
Data aggregation helps in summarizing and condensing data, making it easier to interpret and draw meaningful conclusions.
