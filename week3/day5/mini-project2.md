# Mini-project 2: Data Preprocessing for Wine Quality Analysis

## What You Will Learn
- Advanced data loading and exploration with Pandas.
- Data cleaning and preprocessing techniques.

## Your Task:
Using the Wine Quality dataset, explore the following questions:
- How do different chemical properties correlate with the quality of wine?
- Is there a significant difference in quality between red and white wines?

## Resources
Use the [Wine Quality dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/uciml/red-wine-quality-cortez-et-al-2009) available on Kaggle.

## Hint
1. **Introduction to the Dataset**:
   - Download the dataset from Kaggle.
   - Load the dataset using Pandas.
   - Conduct initial exploration to understand the dataset's structure and the distribution of key variables.

2. **Data Cleaning and Preprocessing**:
   - Handle missing values and outliers.
   - Analyze and potentially transform skewed distributions.
   - Create derived variables if necessary (e.g., acidity levels, sugar content).
