# Exercise: Exploring Python and Data Analysis with Google Colab, Jupyter, and Kaggle

## What we will learn

- Basic Python programming in Google Colab and Jupyter Notebook
- Accessing and analyzing datasets from Kaggle
- Basic data analysis techniques in Python

<br>

## What you will create

- Python scripts in Google Colab and Jupyter Notebook
- Outputs displaying dataset summaries and basic data analysis results

<br>

### Exercise 1: Basic Python Programming with Google Colab.
- Create a new notebook in Google Colab.
- Write a Python script to check if a given number is a prime number. For example, check if the number 7 is prime.

### Exercise 2: List Comprehensions with Jupyter Notebook.
- Launch Jupyter Notebook on your local machine.
- Create a new notebook.
- Write a Python script using list comprehensions to find all numbers in a given range (e.g., 1 to 20) that are divisible by a specific number (e.g., 3).

### Exercise 3: Kaggle Dataset Exploration: Print Dataset Information
- Choose a dataset other than Titanic from Kaggle (e.g., Iris Dataset).
-  Write a script to print the head, columns, and data types of the chosen dataset (either on Google Colab or Jupyter notebook)

### Exercise 4: Basic Data Analysis with Kaggle
-  Select a simple dataset from Kaggle (e.g., Boston Housing Dataset).
-  Perform basic data analysis to find the mean, median, and standard deviation of a particular column.
