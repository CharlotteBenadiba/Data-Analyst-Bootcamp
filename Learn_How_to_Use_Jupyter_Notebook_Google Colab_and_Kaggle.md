## Jupyter Notebook Basics

### Task:

Learn to create, run, and save a Jupyter Notebook. Follow these steps:

1. **Opening Jupyter Notebook**:
    - After installing Anaconda, open the Anaconda Navigator.
    - Click on the Jupyter Notebook icon to launch it. This will open a new tab or window in your default web browser with the Jupyter Notebook interface.
If you installed Jupyter Notebook with pip, type the command "jupyter notebook" in a terminal to open the interface. 

2. **Creating a New Notebook**:
    - In the Jupyter Notebook interface, navigate to the directory where you want to create the notebook.
    - Click on the ‚ÄúNew‚Äù button at the top right and select ‚ÄúPython 3‚Äù from the dropdown. This will create and open a new notebook.

3. **Writing Code**:
    - In the new notebook, you'll see a cell where you can start typing your Python code.
    - Enter the following code in the cell:
        ```python
        # Simple Python code to display text
        print("Hello, Jupyter!")
        ```
    - This is a simple Python command that prints out the text "Hello, Jupyter!".

4. **Running the Code**:
    - To run the code, press `Shift + Enter` or click the "Run" button in the toolbar. 
    - The output of the code will appear immediately below the cell.

5. **Saving the Notebook**:
    - To save your work, go to the File menu and select "Save and Checkpoint", or click on the floppy disk icon in the toolbar.
    - Give your notebook a meaningful name by clicking on the notebook title at the top (next to the Jupyter logo) and typing in your preferred name.

6. **Closing the Notebook**:
    - When you're done, you can close the browser tab.
    - To shut down the notebook server, go back to the terminal where you launched Jupyter Notebook and press `Ctrl + C`.

## Google Colab Introduction

### Task: Create and Share a Google Colab Notebook

In this task, you will learn how to use Google Colab by creating a new notebook, writing some Python code, and then sharing it with a peer for collaboration. Follow these steps:

#### Step 1: Open Google Colab and Start a New Notebook

1. Navigate to [Google Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/).
2. Sign in with your Google account and go to your drive.
3. Click on `New`button at the top left and go to `More`then select `Google Colaboratory` to create a fresh notebook.
4. Rename the notebook to something relevant, like "First Colab Experiment." by clicking on the "Untitled.py" at the top left.

#### Step 2: Write Simple Python Code

1. In the first cell of the notebook, write a Python comment with your name and the date, e.g., `# Created by [Your Name] on [Date]`.
2. Below the comment, write a simple Python code, for example:

   ```python
   # Print a welcome message
   print("Hello, Google Colab!")

3. Run the cell by clicking the play button on the left side of the cell or by pressing `Shift + Enter`.
4. In Google Collab, there is two types of cells : `Text` cells and `Code cells`. To  add a `Text` cell, you click on "+Text" at the right top. It can be useful to write comments or titles in the Notebook.

#### Step 3: Share the Notebook with a Peer

1. Click on the `Share` button located at the top right corner of the notebook.
2. Enter the email address of your peer or generate a shareable link.
3. Set the sharing permissions to either `Viewer` or `Editor` based on your preference.
4. Send the link to your peer and ask them to open it.

#### Step 4: Understanding GPUs and TPUs

What is a GPU?

- **GPU** stands for **Graphics Processing Unit**.
- It's specialized hardware designed originally for rendering graphics.
- In data science, GPUs are used for parallel processing, significantly speeding up tasks like machine learning and deep learning.
- GPUs are well-suited for computations that can be run in parallel, making them efficient for algorithms where tasks can be processed simultaneously.

What is a TPU?

- **TPU** stands for **Tensor Processing Unit**.
- Developed by Google, TPUs are custom-built for machine learning tasks.
- They are designed to accelerate neural network computations specifically.
- TPUs are highly efficient in terms of speed and power consumption for tasks like training and running machine learning models.

How to Modify GPU/TPU Settings in Google Colab

1. **Selecting the Runtime Type**:
   - In your Google Colab notebook, go to the menu bar and click on `Runtime`.
   - Choose `Change runtime type` from the dropdown menu.

2. **Changing the Hardware Accelerator**:
   - In the `Runtime type` settings, you'll find the `Hardware accelerator` dropdown.
   - Select `GPU` or `TPU` based on your requirements.
   - Click `Save` to apply the changes.

3. **Utilizing the GPU/TPU in Code**:
   - After changing the settings, your notebook will have access to the selected hardware.
   - You can now write code that leverages the GPU or TPU for faster computations.

Benefits:

- Using GPUs and TPUs can drastically reduce the time required for training complex machine learning models.
- They enable the processing of larger datasets that might be impractical on standard CPUs.
- Google Colab provides access to these resources for free, making advanced computations accessible to a wider audience.

Remember, while TPUs are faster for certain tasks, they require specific types of models and code adjustments to fully utilize their capabilities.


‚úÖ Knowledge Check: What are the benefits of using Google Colab for collaborative projects?

- [ ] A. Access to free GPUs and TPUs for computing.
- [ ] B. Ability to run Python code in the cloud without any setup.
- [ ] C. Exclusive access to Google's internal data sets.

Check all that apply. You can find the answers at the end of the lesson.

üöÄ Challenge: Collaboratively write a Python script to sort a list of numbers in a shared Google Colab notebook.

#### Exercise in class

Write a Python script to merge two dictionaries. Solution: `merge_dictionaries.py`
